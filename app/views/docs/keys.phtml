<p>Using your API Keys, you can access Appwrite services using the SDK of your choice. To create a new API key, go to your API keys tab in your project setting using your Appwrite console and click the 'Add API Key' button.</p>

<p>When adding a new API Key, you can choose which scope to grant your application. If you need to replace your API Key, create a new key, update your app credentials and, once ready, delete your old key.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h2>Best Practice</h2>
  <p>It is a best practice to grant only the scopes you need to meet your project's goals to an API key. API keys should be treated as a secret. Never share the API key and keep API keys out of client applications.</p>
